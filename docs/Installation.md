# Installation

I recommend using Rojo, as its where the power of Ro-Lib really shines. Its also best used with git.
Also, you should update the module to new versions regularly.

**Roblox Studio:**

* Get the Module from the [Library](https://www.roblox.com/library/7011462318/Ro-Lib) or from [github realeases](https://github.com/HawDevelopment/Ro-Lib/releases).
* Place the Module within ReplicatedStorage.

**Rojo workflow:**

* Download the Ro-Lib from the latest [release](https://github.com/HawDevelopment/Ro-Lib/releases).
* Extract the Module from the zipped file.
* Place the Module in ReplicatedStorage.

**Git workflow:**

* Run ```git submodule add https://github.com/HawDevelopment/Ro-Lib.git```
* Point the Submodule folder to ReplicatedStorage using Rojo.
